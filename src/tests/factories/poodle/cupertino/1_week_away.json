The benefits of spaying and neutering include controlling the pet population, preventing certain diseases, and reducing behavioral problems. Preventing pet overpopulation is one of the most significant benefits. Each year, millions of unwanted shelter animals are euthanized. Controlling the pet population combats this tragedy. By spaying and neutering, owners can prevent their pets from contributing to the problem."

Crate training taps into your pup’s natural inclination to keep their sleeping space clean—they’re less likely to go potty where they hang out and sleep. Using a crate has benefits beyond just potty training, too; it also helps to keep your dog safe and out of mischief when you’re not around to supervise them, plus it provides a comfy retreat when household hubbub gets overwhelming and your pup wants to relax."
